STM32 targets based on libopencm3

libopencm3 should make it possible to have a largely common core port for all
devices supported by libopencm3, with only board specifics like clock speeds
and radio connections in the platform code.  This should hopefully avoid a
proliferation of trivially different cpu/arm/xxxx implementations
